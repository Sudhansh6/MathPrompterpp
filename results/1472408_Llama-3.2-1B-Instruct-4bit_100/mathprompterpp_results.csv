Danny collects bottle caps. He lost 66 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,Addition,91.0,,,,Danny collects bottle caps. He lost var_A bottle caps at the park. Now he has var_B bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"Here are the rough steps to solve the problem:

1. Let's say Danny had x bottle caps initially.
2. We know that he lost 66 bottle caps at the park.
3. After losing 66 bottle caps, Danny has 25 bottle caps left.
4. To find the initial number of bottle caps, we need to add the number of lost caps to the number of caps he has left.
5. So, the equation will be: x + 66 = 25
6. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x.
7. We can do this by subtracting 66 from both sides of the equation.
8. This will give us: x = 25 - 66
9. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = -41

There are var_B students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are var_C seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?,"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students and divide it by the number of seats on each bus.

1. First, we need to find the number of students per bus. Since there are 58 students in the school and each classroom has the same number of students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to find the number of students per bus. 
   Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of classrooms
   Number of students per bus = 58 / 87
   Number of students per bus = 0.66 (approximately)

2. Now that we know the number of students per bus, we can find the total number of buses needed by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per bus.

2. Since you had 14 bags with equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies is 14x.
3. You had 28 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation 14x = 28.
4. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14.
5. This gives us x = 28 / 14 = 2.
6. Since we know the number of cookies in each bag is 2, we can find the number of bags of cookies by dividing the total number of cookies (28) by the number of cookies in each bag (2).
7. This gives us 28 / 2 = 14 bags of cookies.

He lost var_A bottle caps at the park. Now he has var_B bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"Here are the rough steps to solve the problem:

1. Let's say Danny had x bottle caps initially.
2. We know that he lost 66 bottle caps at the park.
3. After losing 66 bottle caps, Danny has 25 bottle caps left.
4. To find the initial number of bottle caps, we need to add the number of lost caps to the number of caps he has left.
