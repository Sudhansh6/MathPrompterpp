Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as you can't give a fraction of a cracker or cake), the maximum integer value for \( x \) that satisfies both inequalities is \( 0 \).

Thus, each friend received:
- **0 crackers**
- **0 cakes**

Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,Subtraction,17.0,2.0,"Let's define the number of marbles Doug originally had as \( D \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can express the number of marbles Ed had as \( D + 2 \).

When Doug lost some marbles, let's say he lost \( x \) marbles. After losing these marbles, Doug now has \( D - x \) marbles.

At this point, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
D + 2 = (D - x) + 19
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   D + 2 = D - x + 19
   \]

2. Subtract \( D \) from both sides:
   \[
   2 = -x + 19

Now we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
\text{Initial children} - \text{Children getting off} + \text{Children getting on} = \text{Final children}
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[
36 - 68 + x = 12

So the equation becomes:

\[
-32 + xTo solve for \( x \):

\[
-32 + x = 12

Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?,Subtraction,14.0,1.0,"To determine how many goldfish disappeared, we can start by analyzing the information given:

1. Paige initially raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish.
2. The total number of fish she started with is:
   \[
   16 \text{ (goldfish)} + 71 \text{ (catfish)} = 87 \text{ (total fish)}
   \]
3. After some time, she has only 2 fish left.

Now, we need to find out how many fish disappeared:
\[
87 \text{ (initial total)} - 2 \text{ (remaining)} = 85 \text{ (disappeared fish)}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of those 85 disappeared fish were goldfish. Since we know she started with 16 goldfish, we can denote the number of goldfish that disappeared as \( x \) and the number of catfish that disappeared as \( y \).

We have two equationsTo find out how many goldfish disappeared, we can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of fish that disappeared is:
   \[
   x + y = 85
   \]
   where \( x \) is the number of goldfish that disappeared and \( y \) is the number of catfish that disappeared.

2. Since Paige started with 16 goldfish, the number of goldfish left is:
   \[
   16 - x
   \]
   And since she has 2 fish left in total, we can express the number of catfish left as:
   \[
   71 - y
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (16 - x) + (71 - y) = 2
   \]

Now, simplifying the second equation:
\[
16 - x + 71 - y = 2
