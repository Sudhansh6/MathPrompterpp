 Sarah's old washing machine could only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? ,9,9.0,"To find out how many loads Sarah needs to do, we need to divide the total number of shirts and sweaters by the number of items she can wash at a time.

Step 1: Divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts she can wash at a time.
43 shirts / 5 shirts per load = 8.6 loads

Step 2: Since you can't do a fraction of a load, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
8.6 loads -> 9 loads

Step 3: Divide the total number of sweaters by the number of sweaters she can wash at a time.
2 sweaters / 5 sweaters per load = 0.4 loads

Step 4: Since you can't do a fraction of a load, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
0.4 loads -> 0 loads

So, Sarah would need to do 9 loads to wash all the shirts andTo find the total number of loads Sarah needs to do, we need to add the number of loads for the shirts and sweaters.
