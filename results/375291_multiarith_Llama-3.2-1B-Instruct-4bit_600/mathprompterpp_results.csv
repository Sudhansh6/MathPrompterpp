1. Let's start by identifying the total number of items Sarah needs to wash: 43 shirts + 2 sweaters = 45 items.
2. Since the washing machine can only wash 5 items at a time, we need to divide the total number of items by the washing capacity to find the number of loads.

2. We know that 51 students wanted fruit, but we don't know how many apples they wanted. Let's call the number of apples they wanted 'x'.
3. Since the cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples, the total number of apples they ordered is 82. We can set up the equation: 37 + 45 = 82.
4. We can simplify the equation by adding the two numbers: 82 = 82.

If each pile had var_C coins in it, how many coins did he have total?","Here are the rough steps to solve the problem:

1. Let's start by finding the total number of quarters and dimes Luke has. 
2. Since each pile has 3 coins, we can find the total number of coins by multiplying the number of piles by 3.
3. Luke has 5 piles of quarters, so we multiply 5 by 3 to find the total number of quarters: 5 x 3 = 15.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of dimes. Since each pile has 5 dimes, we multiply 5 by 5 to find the total number of dimes: 5 x 5 = 25.
5. Finally, we add the total number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins: 15 + 25 = 40.

3. We know that each van can hold 5 people. To find the number of vans needed, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold. vans_needed = total_people / 5

1. Let's start by finding out how many cupcakes Haley has left after Todd ate 11.
2. To find the number of cupcakes left, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes eaten from the total number of cupcakes baked.
3. So, the number of cupcakes left is 20 - 11 = 9.
4. Now, we need to find out how many packages of cupcakes Haley can make with 9 cupcakes in each package.

1. Let's say the number of pounds of paper recycled by Vanessa is V and the number of pounds of paper recycled by her friends is F.
2. We know that for every 9 pounds of paper recycled, they earn 1 point. So, we can set up the equation:
   V = 9x
   F = 9y
3. We also know that Vanessa recycled 20 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds. So, we can set up the equation:
   20 = 9x
   16 = 9y

1. Let's say Dave washed x shirts.

4. We know that the total number of shirts washed is the sum of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts.

If var_B of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into var_C groups, how many students would be in each group?","Here are the rough steps to solve the problem:

1. First, find the number of students who got picked for the team. 
   - Subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students.
   - students_picked = total_students - students_not_picked
   - students_picked = 25 - 15
   - students_picked = 10

2. Now, divide the number of students who got picked by 2 to find the number of students in each group.
   - students_per_group = students_picked / 2
   - students_per_group = 10 / 2
   - students_per_group = 5

So, there would be 5 students in each group.",10 / 2,"def solution(var_A, var_B, var_C):
