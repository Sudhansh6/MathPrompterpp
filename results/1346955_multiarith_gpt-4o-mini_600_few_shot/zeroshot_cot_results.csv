" Robin uploaded 35 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? ",8,8.0,"Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Pictures**: First, we need to find out the total number of pictures Robin uploaded. She uploaded 35 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera. 

   \[
   \text{Total Pictures} = 35 + 5 = 40
   \]

2. **Number of Albums**: Robin sorted the pictures into 5 different albums.

3. **Pictures per Album**: To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

So, there are **8 pictures in each album**.8",False,
" At the fair there were 30 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left and 5 more got in line, how many people would be in line? ",25,25.0,"Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of people in line**: There are 30 people in line for the bumper cars.

2. **People who left the line**: 10 people got tired of waiting and left. 
   - So, we subtract 10 from the initial number: 
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

3. **People who joined the line**: 5 more people got in line.
   - Now, we add these 5 people to the current number in line:

So, Edward ended up with **24 good games**.24",False,
" Gwen earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 4 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them, how many points would she have earned? ",16,16.0,"Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of bags recycled**: Gwen had a total of 4 bags, but she didn't recycle 2 of them. So, the number of bags she actually recycled is:
   \[
   4 - 2 = 2 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. **Calculate the points earned per bag**: Gwen earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycles.

" Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 4 people and there are 2 students and 6 adults going, how many vans will they need? ",2,2.0,"Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Count the total number of people going on the trip**:
   - Number of students: 2
   - Number of adults: 6
   - Total number of people = Number of students + Number of adults
   - Total number of people = 2 + 6 = 8

2. **Determine how many people each van can hold**:
   - Each van can hold 4 people.

3. **Calculate the number of vans needed**:
   - To find out how many vans are needed, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.
   - Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
   - Number of vans needed = 8 / 4 = 2
