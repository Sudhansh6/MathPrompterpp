2. Each group has 2 eggs.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the phrasing. If each group has 2 eggs, then it doesn't align with the idea of splitting into groups of 11. 

Let's clarify:

- If Rebecca is splitting the eggs into groups of 11, then each group should contain 11 eggs.
- If she is splitting them into groups of 2, then each group would contain 2 eggs.

Assuming she is splitting them into groups of 11, we can denote the total number of eggs as \( E \). 

If she splits them into groups of 11, the number of groups would be \( \frac{E}{11} \).

If she splits them into groups of 2, the number of groups would be \( \frac{E}{2}To clarify the situation, if Rebecca is splitting her collection of eggs into groups of 11, then each group should contain 11 eggs.
