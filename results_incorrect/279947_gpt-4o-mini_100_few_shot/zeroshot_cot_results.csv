Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,Subtraction,17.0,2.0,"Let's define the number of marbles Doug originally had as \( D \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can express the number of marbles Ed had as \( D + 2 \).

When Doug lost some marbles, let's say he lost \( x \) marbles. After losing these marbles, Doug now has \( D - x \) marbles.

At this point, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
D + 2 = (D - x) + 19
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   D + 2 = D - x + 19
   \]

2. Subtract \( D \) from both sides:
   \[
   2 = -x + 19
   \]

3. Rearranging gives:
   \To solve for \( x \), we continue from the equation we derived:

\[
2 = -x + 19
\]

Now, let's isolate \( x \):

1. Subtract 19 from both sides:
   \[
   2 - 19 = -x
   \]
   \[
   -17 = -x
   \]

2. Multiply both sides by -1:
   \[
   x = 17

A farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 134 of them yesterday and 30 today. How many will he have left after today?,Subtraction,7.0,7.0,"Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total tomatoes initially**: The farmer had 171 tomatoes.
2. **Tomatoes picked yesterday**: He picked 134 tomatoes yesterday.
3. **Tomatoes picked today**: He picked 30 tomatoes today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes he picked:

\[
\text{Total picked} = \text{Tomatoes picked yesterday} + \text{Tomatoes picked today} = 134 + 30 = 164
\]

Next, we subtract the total picked from the initial number of tomatoes to find out how many he has left:

1. **Initial number of children on the bus**: 36 children.

2. **Children getting off the bus**: 68 children got off the bus.

3. **Children getting on the bus**: Let's denote the number of children that got on the bus as \( x \).

4. **Final number of children on the bus**: After some children got off and some got on, there were 12 children left on the bus.

Now we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
\text{Initial children} - \text{Children getting off} + \text{Children getting on} = \text{Final children}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
36 - 68 + x = 12
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
36 - 68 = -32
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
-32 + x = 12To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
x = 12 + 32
\]

Calculating that gives:

\[
x = 44
\]

So, 44 children got on the bus.

Now, we need to find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on. 

The number of children that got off the bus is 68, and the number that got on is 44. 

To find the difference:

\[
68 - 44 = 24

Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?,Subtraction,14.0,1.0,"To determine how many goldfish disappeared, we can start by analyzing the information given:

1. Paige initially raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish.
2. The total number of fish she had at the beginning was:
   \[
   16 \text{ (goldfish)} + 71 \text{ (catfish)} = 87 \text{ (total fish)}
   \]
3. After some time, she ended up with only 2 fish left.

Now, we need to find out how many fish disappeared. The number of fish that disappeared is:
\[
87 \text{ (initial total)} - 2 \text{ (remaining)} = 85 \text{ (disappeared)}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of those 85 disappeared were goldfish. Since we know that stray cats were eating the fish, we can assume that both goldfish and catfish could have been eaten.

Let’s denote:
- \( xTo find out how many goldfish disappeared, we can denote the number of goldfish that disappeared as \( x \) and the number of catfish that disappeared as \( y \).

From the information given:
1. Paige started with 16 goldfish and 71 catfish.
2. After some time, she had 2 fish left.

The total number of fish that disappeared is:
\[
87 \text{ (initial total)} - 2 \text{ (remaining)} = 85 \text{ (disappeared)}
\]

We can set up the following equations based on the initial counts and the remaining fish:
1. The total number of fish that disappeared:
   \[
   x + y = 85
   \]
2. The number of fish remaining:
   \[
   (16 - x) + (71 - y) = 2
