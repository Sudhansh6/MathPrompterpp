5. Then Jake has y + 9 peaches.
6. We know that Jake has 9 peaches more than Jill, so y + 9 = x.

3. The total number of apples on the trees is 3x + 3x = 6x.
4. We know that the trees have a total of 9 apples still on them, so we can set up the equation:
6x = 9
5. Divide both sides by 6 to find the initial number of apples on the trees:
x = 9/6
