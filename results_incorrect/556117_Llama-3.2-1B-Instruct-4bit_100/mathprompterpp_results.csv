   Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes, so the total number of crackers and cakes is 13 + 15 = 28.

2. Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by 28 to find the number of crackers and cakes each person ate. 
   Number of crackers each person ate = Total crackers / 28 = 13 / 28 = 0.46 (approximately)
   Number of cakes each person ate = Total cakes / 28 = 15 / 28 = 0.53 (approximately)
