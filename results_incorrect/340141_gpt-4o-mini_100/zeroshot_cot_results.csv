Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,Subtraction,17.0,2.0,"Let's define the number of marbles Doug originally had as \( D \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can express the number of marbles Ed had as \( D + 2 \).

When Doug lost some marbles, let's say he lost \( x \) marbles. After losing these marbles, Doug now has \( D - x \) marbles.

At this point, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
D + 2 = (D - x) + 19
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   D + 2 = D - x + 19
   \]

2. Subtract \( D \) from both sides:
   \[
   2 = -x + 19

Now, let's isolate \( x \):

1. Subtract 19 from both sides:
   \[
   2 - 19 = -x
   \]
   \[
   -17 = -x
   \]

2. Multiply both sides by -1:

4. **Final number of children on the bus**: After some children got off and some got on, there were 12 children left on the bus.

Now we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
\text{Initial children} - \text{Children getting off} + \text{Children getting on} = \text{Final children}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
36 - 68 + x = 12
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
36 - 68 = -32

So the equation becomes:

\[
-32 + x = 12To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
x = 12 + 32
\]

Calculating that gives:

\[
x = 44
\]

This means 44 children got on the bus.

Now, we need to find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on. 

The number of children that got off the bus is 68, and the number that got on is 44. 

To find the difference:

Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?,Subtraction,14.0,85.0,"To determine how many goldfish disappeared, we can start by analyzing the information given:

1. Paige initially had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish.
2. The total number of fish she had at the beginning was:
   \[
   16 \text{ (goldfish)} + 71 \text{ (catfish)} = 87 \text{ (total fish)}
   \]
3. After some time, she ended up with only 2 fish left.

Now, we need to find out how many fish disappeared. The number of fish that disappeared is:
\[
87 \text{ (initial total)} - 2 \text{ (remaining)} = 85 \text{ (disappeared)}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of those 85 disappeared were goldfish. Since we know she started with 16 goldfish, we can denote the number of goldfish that disappeared as \( x \) and the number of catfish that85 - x, where \( x \) is the number of goldfish that disappeared. 

Since she started with 71 catfish and ended up with 2 fish total, we can assume that the remaining fish are catfish. Therefore, if \( y \) is the number of catfish that disappeared, we have:

1. The total number of fish that disappeared is 85.
2. The number of catfish remaining is \( 71 - y \).

Since she has only 2 fish left, and we assume they are catfish, we can conclude that:

\[
71 - y = 2 \implies y = 69
\]

Now, substituting \( y \) back into the equation for the total number of disappeared fish:

\[
x + y = 85 \implies x + 69 = 85 \implies x = 16
\]

Thus, the number of goldfish that disappeared is:
