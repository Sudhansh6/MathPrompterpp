The percentage reduction in systolic pressure is calculated by subtracting the new systolic pressure (120 mmHg) from the initial systolic pressure (140 mmHg), dividing that difference by the initial systolic pressure, and then multiplying by 100. In this case, the percentage reduction is 14..'}

To calculate the log reduction, you subtract the log of the final viral load from the log of the initial viral load. In this case, log(100,000) - log(1,000) = 5 - 3 = 2.0.'}

To convert ng/mL to μg/L, you need to multiply by 1000 (since 1 μg = 1000 ng and 1 mL = 1 L). Therefore, 25 ng/mL is equivalent to 25,000 μg/L.'}

To find the total energy expenditure in 8 hours, you need to multiply the metabolic rate per minute by the number of minutes in 8 hours. The correct calculation is:\n1.2 kcal/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 576 kcal.'}

The average growth rate per division can be calculated by taking the 4th root of the final cell count divided by the initial cell count, which in this case is the 4th root of 64,000/1,000, resulting in an average growth rate of 4.0 per division.'}
